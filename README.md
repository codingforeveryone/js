This repository was created to post javascript files and open issues related to them, fix bugs in codes, write functions and other activities associated with programming in javascript, all while building skills and confidence with GitHub.

Here is how the workflow works in this repository:

 - For each new challenge, the author creates a new branch named after the task and creates an issue describing the challenge.
 - If any of contributors want to take the challenge, he replies to the issue so the others won't try to push their solutions at the same time. It would mean that this person 'reserved' a spot for solving the problem.
 - When a solution is ready, the changes can be pushed to the branch named after the task and then, a pull request created (from that branch to master). So even if the solution isn't correct, it won't be pushed to master branch yet and can be corrected easily.
 - If the person who created the challenge decides that the solution is correct, he/she can merge the pull request into the master.
 
As per your preference you can create a working branch of master within this repository or "fork" this repository into your own GitHub environment. Please make sure to synchronize a fork with upstream repository before creating a pull request so there will be no any conflicts in request. See the guide below for assistance.
